# Ecommerce Data Analysis and Purchase pattern discovery using Apriori Algorithm 
In this project, I analysed ecommerce data to discover patterns in purchase behaviour and product associations in different countries. The goal was to identify potential products that could increase monthly revenue. I used the Apriori algorithm to examine how users select items when making a purchase or adding multiple items to their cart. Through this analysis, I identified patterns in the combination of products that are purchased together and identified opportunities to increase revenue by making targeted product recommendations
